# How to use:

First install the plugin by adding it to the *KERNEL line             
after that create a folder on ux0 called "rePatch"          
inside that folder put another folder of the titleid for the game           
and in there, simply place the files you want to replace,           
it works exactly the same as ux0:patch does on 3.60.            
only you dont need the param.sfo file in sce_sys.

Intended to allow you to patch games even if theres an update installed.              
But i suppose it could potentally fix the ux0:patch problem on >3.61 if the plugin where to be ported to that firmware.
