# rePatch reDux0:

This plugin serves as a substitute for the patch folder when an existing update is present on official cartridges or other encrypted formats. It also has the benefit of loading decrypted content on 3.65.

**To clarify: this plugin works on both 3.65 and 3.60 on NoNpDrm, official cartridges, and officially downloaded games.**

Note: Be wary of using a Vitamin dumped(or similar) eboot, it will be affected by save issues. 

**NOTE: IF YOUR GAME DLC DOES NOT WORK, TRY RUNNING rePATCH AIDS**
