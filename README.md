# How to use:

3.65 Confirmed working: https://twitter.com/dots_tb/status/972922611536576512

IF THE PATCH REQUIRES AN EBOOT IT WILL NOT WORK ATM!

First install the plugin by adding it to the *KERNEL line             
after that create a folder on ux0 called "rePatch"          
inside that folder put another folder of the titleid for the game           
and in there, simply place the files you want to replace,           
it works exactly the same as ux0:patch does on 3.60.            
only you dont need the param.sfo file in sce_sys.
