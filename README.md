# How to use:

First install the plugin by adding it to the *KERNEL line


after that create a folder on ux0 called "rePatch"


inside that folder put another folder of the titleid for the game


and in there, simply place the files you want to replace,


it works exactly the same as ux0:patch does on 3.60.


only you dont need the param.sfo file in sce_sys.

(tbh i dont think livearea mods or param.sfo mods would work)

I dont think it would work on 3.65 as-is but if someone ports it over it could potentally fix the ux0:patch issue.
